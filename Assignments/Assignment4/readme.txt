This assignment demonstrates the effectiveness of K-means clustering in partitioning data into distinct clusters based on similarity. We have explored its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility, showcasing its applicability across various domains such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and document clustering. However, the algorithm's performance is influenced by factors like initial centroid selection and the determination of the optimal number of clusters.
